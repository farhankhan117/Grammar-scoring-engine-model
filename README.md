# Grammar Scoring Engine â€“ SHL Kaggle Competition

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
Built a machine learning model to predict grammar scores (0â€“5) from spoken English audio samples using MFCC features and regression modeling.

## ðŸ›  Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Librosa
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## ðŸ“Œ Summary of Steps
- Extracted MFCC features from `.wav` audio files
- Trained a Random Forest Regressor on labeled grammar scores
- Evaluated model using RMSE and Pearson correlation
- Predicted scores for test set and created `submission.csv`
- Visualized predicted vs actual scores using scatter plots

## âœ… Conclusion
Successfully developed a grammar scoring engine with strong training accuracy. The model processes audio input and predicts grammar proficiency effectively.
